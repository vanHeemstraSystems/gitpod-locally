# 100 - Introduction

run-gp is a CLI tool for running workspaces based on a ```.gitpod.yml``` file locally on your machine. Using a local working copy it produces a workspace image, and starts that workspace. This provides an experience akin to a regular Gitpod workspace.

**Warning**: This is an experiment. When you find an issue, [please report it](https://github.com/gitpod-io/run-gp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) so that we can improve this project.

**Note** ```run-gp``` is not the "real Gitpod experience". Gitpod offers remote development environments which sport many benefits compared to running things locally. Head over to https://www.gitpod.io to find out more.
